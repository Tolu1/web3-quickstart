## Modern Web3 Template

Are you new to the web3 space and looking to quickly get started with building decentralized applications? If so, this template is perfect for you! It provides a boilerplate setup for both smart contract development and frontend development.

## Hardhat

This template uses Hardhat, a popular development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, to provide a solid foundation for your smart contract development needs. It also utilizes TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, which helps catch errors before they happen and makes your code more reliable.

## Next.js & RainbowKit

On the frontend side, this template uses Next.js, a popular React framework, to provide an easy-to-use development environment for building modern web applications. In addition, it includes RainbowKit, a library that simplifies wallet integrations, so you can easily add wallet functionality to your application without having to worry about the implementation details.

## Wagmi

Finally, this template includes Wagmi, a library that simplifies interaction with your smart contract. With Wagmi, you can easily call your contract's functions from your frontend code, making it easy to build powerful and interactive decentralized applications.

## Why we are builing this project?

This template provides a great starting point for anyone looking to build decentralized applications using modern web development tools and techniques.
